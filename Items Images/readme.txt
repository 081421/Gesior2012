1. How to install/update your accout maker images to X.XX version of Tibia?
- Download .zip file with images version that you want from Downloads ( https://github.com/gesior/Gesior2012/downloads )
- Linux (I hope you know how to unzip on windows):
- - Upload it to dedic to account maker folder 'images' and in console (Putty) type: unzip items_images_XXX.zip (XXX your version)
- - It can take around minute to unzip ~15000 images, they will appear in account maker folder 'images/items/' - your account maker images are installed/updated!

2. Where are these images used in account maker?
You can see them on page that shows information about player (items of player) and on Shop page it shows image (offered item image)

Info:
Tibia item images were generated from Tibia.spr, Tibia.dat and items.otb of X.XX version of Tibia/OTS (by my .php script) and zipped, in each .zip is around 15000 images (90-95% of all images from that version, also walls, ground etc. not only items that player can wear).
In each .zip are also files 'ots_error.txt' and 'dat_error.txt' in which are IDs of items not generated, because they did not exist in .otb or my script couldn't get informations about them from .dat file.
Some PCs (with windows) can slow down when you open folder with so many files. Better use option 'Extract to...' (to unzip file) if possible.
