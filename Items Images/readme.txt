1. What files are in this folder?
In this folder you can find Tibia item images [.gif] generated from Tibia.spr, Tibia.dat and items.otb of X.XX version of Tibia/OTS and zipped, because in each .zip around 15000 images (90-95% of all images from that version, also walls, ground etc. not only items that player can wear) and some PCs (windows) can slow down when you open folder with so many files.
2. How to update my acc. maker images to X.XX version of Tibia?
- Download .zip file with version that you want
- Linux (I hope you know how to unzip on windows):
- - Upload it to dedic to acc. maker folder 'images' and in console (Putty) type: unzip items_images_XXX.zip (XXX your version)
- - It can take around minute to unzip ~15000 images, they will appear in acc. maker folder 'images/items/' - your acc. maker images are updated!
3. Where are these images used in acc. maker?
You can see them on page that shows information about player (items of player) and on Shop page it shows image (offered item image)
